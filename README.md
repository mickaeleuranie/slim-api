## API calls

### API keys

To add a new API key and link him to a user, you need to add an entry in `api_key` table first, then in `user_api_key` with last created `api_key` id.

### Tokens

New access token in created when user logs in. You can define a token as permanent by adding `permanent` value in `oauth_access_tokens.type` field.

If a token isn't permanent, its expire date will be updated to 24h after last call. If a token isn't valid anymore, user will need to log in again.

### How to pass API key and token ?

#### V1

You can pass `apikey` and `access_token` parameters in query params or in request HEADERS. The later is the one you should use.
Passing them in query params functionnality will probably be removed in future versions.

##### From query params

```
http(s)://your-domain.com[/your-path]/controller/action?apikey=API_KEY&access_token=TOKEN
```

##### From request HEADERS

HEADERS parameters names are formatted like this : [API_REQUEST_HEADERS_PREFIX]_KEY and [API_REQUEST_HEADERS_PREFIX]_TOKEN. `[API_REQUEST_HEADERS_PREFIX]` value is defined in `.env` file.

Example :

```
X-SLIM-API-KEY: API_KEY_VALUE
X-SLIM-API-TOKEN: TOKEN_VALUE
```
